Simple document
================

I’m an R Markdown document\!

# Section 1

Here’s a **code chunk** that samples from a *normal distribution*:

``` r
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

    ## [1] 100

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too\! The mean is -0.1586003.

## test result

``` r
data_rand = rnorm(10, sd = 2)
```
